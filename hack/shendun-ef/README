ShenDun-ExecFilter
==================

    ShenDun-ExecFilter is a security extension to protect your system away from
    the hackers.

    It's behavior like an execution guard, only specific processes maybe spawned
    from certain commands.  For example, services like `httpd` should never
    launch disk partition managers. These type of operations are mostly invoked
    by malicious system invaders.

    ShenDun-ExecFilter has a remotely managed configuration server. Where the
    latest settings are created. The local system are updated hourly to keep the
    knowledge on time.
