This repository contains my projects for Debian Linux.

It may divide into following categories:

    * Utilities

    * Libraries

    * Preferences or personal configurations
        (pref-*/*)
        There are pre-configured preferences.

        Because I hate to configure the same settings everytime when I re-installed the system,
        so I make these as preference packages.

    * Enhancement for existing tools
        (toolenh/*)
        These are mostly bash-aliases and bash-completion.d/* for easing purpose.

    * Lapiota win32/cygwin/linux misc tools
        Lapiota is a very old toolset (orig. named Diret) I worked on from 1997 maybe.
        It contains tools for DOS, Win32, Win95, etc.

        Most of them are now converted to Linux-compatible tools and splited into separated
        packages.

    * And other stuff.
