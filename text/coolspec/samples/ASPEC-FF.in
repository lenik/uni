SPC File Format
===============

    " α-Spec is a specification language used to describe something like file
    " format, command line synopsis, user guide, etc. It's a wiki-style WYSIWYG
    " language, but more strict syntax within.

    " α-Spec defines a series of lexicographic instances for specific
    " application domains, currently instances for file format, command usage,
    " protocol usage are included, and more will be added in future.

    " The α-Spec project is a tool set for supporting the use of α-Spec in
    " practical development.

    " α-Spec file contains three parts as below:

    [ layout ]

    REC-L. Leading Screen (stable)

    REC-H. Leading Headers (optional, unstable)
