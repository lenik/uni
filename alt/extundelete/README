To compile and install this program, you should first
install the binary and development packages for
e2fsprogs and e2fslibs.  You must also have a C++
compiler and a make utility to compile extundelete.

To compile the program, run the following commands
from the extundelete-x.y.z directory:
./configure
make

The extundelete program may be run as-is from the build
directory, or you may wish to install it to a directory
that is shared with other executable programs, which you
may do by running the following command:
make install

To see the various supported options, type:
extundelete --help

Example compilation instructions for extundelete 0.2.0:
tar -xjf extundelete-0.2.0.tar.bz2
cd extundelete-0.2.0
./configure
make
src/extundelete --help

A typical usage scenario is presented below.  Note that some
of the commands below require special permissions to
complete.  Adding 'sudo ' before the command is one way to
ensure you have the necessary permissions.  Assume you
have deleted a file called /home/user/an/important/file.
Also assume the output of the 'mount' command shows this
line (among others):
/dev/sda3 on /home type ext3 (rw)
This line shows that the /home directory is on the partition
named /dev/sda3, so then run:
umount /dev/sda3
and check that it is now unmounted by running the mount
command again and seeing it is not listed.
Now, with this information, run extundelete:
extundelete /dev/sda3 --restore-file user/an/important/file
If you have deleted the directory 'important', you can run:
extundelete /dev/sda3 --restore-directory user/an/important
Or if you have deleted everything, you can run:
extundelete /dev/sda3 --restore-all
