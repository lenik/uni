Description: A program to create Microsoft compatible boot records.
    This is a Linux program for writing Microsoft compatible boot records.
    The program does the same as Microsoft "fdisk /mbr" to a hard disk or
    "sys d:" to a floppy or FAT partition except that it does not copy any
    system files, only the boot record is written.
