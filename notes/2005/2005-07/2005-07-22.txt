> simxml charsets

    simxml has a parser structure as:

        layer 1:  common parser - a top-down parser
            common parser is designed for reuse, at first I want to use
            GScanner or some kind of generators like yacc, but they were
            not suitable for parse simxml documents, some reasons as:

                - it's not easy to write lalr(1) definition of simxml,
                  for example, the quoted string in [attribute] is a
                  token, but in normal text of simxml body, it is just
                  literal text.

                - i want the simxml parser support as many charsets as it
                  could, but GScanner seems not support encoding other
                  than ascii very well.

        layer 2:  simxml specific parser
