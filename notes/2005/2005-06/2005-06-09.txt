There're some defects of MSN Messenger, for example, the contact list contains no more than 150 items; the group chat (2 more users chatting) only for online buddies, that is, group chat can't include off-line buddies; you can't send messages to off-line buddies; etc.

The Advanced Group for MSN Messenger has following features:
- make possible of more than 150 contact list
- send message to group which consists of both online and offline buddies, off-line buddies will receive the message when next time start.
- the contact list of group is persistant, so everyone don't have to add all other contact in the members list, this makes the group maintaince easier
- the group is similar to discussion board, everyone is convienient to take part in, and just to join and chat, no other works.
- the protocols to be supported are MSNP8, MSNP9, MSNP10.
