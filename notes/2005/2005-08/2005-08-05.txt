> Sexy sexy lover

Oh I tell you once and I tell you twice
I'll be there for you in your paradise
Oh please stay with me
and I show you what I feel
You're the nearest thing to heaven girl
Baby just for you, I'll fly around the world
Oh everything I'll do, I do it just for you
My sexy, sexy lover, oh tell me there's no other
Tell me there's no other, deep in your heart
My sexy, sexy lover, I wanna be your cover
There's no other, who's breaking apart
Oh my sexy little lover, swear there is no other
I'll feel alone, when I'm coming home
Oh my sexy little lover, tell me there's no other
cuz when I'm down, I need you all around
I am not a man, who wants to be alone
There's a place for us, we can't go wrong
Oh baby you and I, we're flying one mile high
We are more than two, you are more than one
And my love for you is burning like the sun
Oh everything I'll do, I do it just for you


> Lyrics: Don't let me go

A Lonely Avenue -
It's Raining In My Heart
No Name, No Number Girl -
How Can I Try A Start Without You?
I'm As Lonely As A Cloud - Oh, When Your Love Falls Down
You Make The Sun Keep Shining - Oh, When You're Just Around
Oh and you
And Whenever Will Be - I Promise Your Love, Forever My Love

Don't Let Me Go, Little Darling
Oh, No-No-NO-No-No Little Darling
Don't Let Me Go, Little Darling
Oh, No-No-NO-No-No Little Darling
That I'm So In Love With You.....

And When The Sun Goes Down - My World Is In Your Hands
On Silver Clouds We'll Fly - Just To The Raibow's End,
You And I
Only My Shadow Knows - Love Is On My Side
I'll Fly Around The Moon - Just To Hold You Tight
Only You
And Whatever Will Be, I Promise Your Love - Forever My Love

Don't Let Him Know, Little Darling
Oh, No-No-No-No-No Little Darling
Don't Let Him Know, Little Darling
Oh, No-No-No-No-No Little Darling
That I'm So In Love With You.....

We're Flying High And Flying Low
Oh, Babe There's One Thing You Should Know
I'll Never Ever Let You Go.....

That I'll Never Let You Go.....
