Description: A simple bash programming framework.
    bash-shlib introduced library support to bash, you can then
    build up shell programs by libraries.
    All shell libraries (aka. shlib, for bash library) are stored
    in /usr/lib/shlib.d directory. You can import them by import
    statement. All you need is put "source (.) shlib" at the
    beginning of your program.
